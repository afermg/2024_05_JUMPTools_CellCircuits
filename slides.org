- @@b:<2>@@ *Scattered metadata*
  - How do we visualise the images from which a profile was produced?
  - Are these two perturbations from the same batch/plate?

- @@b:<3>@@ *Diverse backgrounds*
  - How can biologists with limited coding experience benefit?
  - How can developers build their own tools?

@@b:<1->@@ I have -omics data for *X* modified gene or chemical compound.
- How do cells affected by *X* look?

=jump_rr= (JUMP Round-Robin) is our Python tool to perform pairwise computations on profiles or features using the GPU. It also processes metadata to build whole image paths.

=Datasette= is a Python libary to visualise, query and edit databases; it is deployable via WebAssembly (runs on the browser).

** How do cells affected by *X* look?
=gallery=: Explore all the images with an associated profile.
[[./imgs/gallery.jpg]]
** What else produces similar morphologies?
=simile=: Find the most similar (and dissimilar) perturbations.
[[./imgs/simile.jpg]]
** What are the distinctive features of *X*-perturbed cells?
=feature=: Find the most distinctive features of a perturbation, or amongst all.
[[./imgs/feature.jpg]]
** Does *X* have an alternative identity?
=broad_babel=: Translates IDs (JUMP, Symbol/InChiKey, Entrez id, Broad) and which are controls.

** The tools can be organised based on question and dataset...

** Ok, that's "fun" and all, but what about developer experience?
pandas! pandas! pandas!
\\
The following tools are available via pip.

** =broad_babel=: Three SQL wrappers in a trenchcoat.
Tool to translate its and provides essential information.
- ID goes in, ID(s) come out
- ID goes in, control metadata comes out

It doubles as a central accessible source of ground truth for identities and metadata.

** =jump_portrait=: Spice-up your workflow with cell images

Fetch a subset of images associated to a perturbation. Optionally, include their respective negative controls.
- Foci-level images are accesible, not single-cell.
- Negative controls is essential to account for +batch effects+.
- Useful to train Deep Learning models on images on-the-fly(?).

** Other nice JUMP-adjacent tools
- jump-dti: Fetch data from drug-target interaction (@John)
- cpg-data: Fetch images for any CellPainting data (@Ank)
- SMILES without borders: Cheminformatics black magic (@Srijit)

** Aren't you just procrastinating the dive into biology?

As a side-note, it would be neat not to suffer an overdose of .ipynb

** JUMP central concentrates knowledge, including (battle-proven) code to keep the evergrowing info in a leash.
