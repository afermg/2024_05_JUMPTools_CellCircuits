#+title: Readme

For this particular slides I use demos, so I use pdf2keynote to insert mp4s manually.
Either use =nix flakes + direnv= for an automated setup or run the setup.

* Setup
#+begin_src shell
python -m venv .venv
pip install git+https://github.com/remymuller/pdf2keynote.git
source activate .venv/bin/activate
#+end_src

* Usage
Once the slides are ready they are autoconverted into keynote
#+begin_src shell
pdf2keynote slides.pdf
#+end_src
Finally add the demos where they should be.

* Video format
Note that videos have to be encoded in H264 for them to be accepted by Keynote. Something along these lines works.
#+begin_src
ffmpeg -i input.fmt -vcodec libx264 -acodec aac output.mov
#+end_src

* Is keynote crashing?
If keynote crashes after adding the videos (which is very frustrating given all the previous work) just export to pptx and show it using MS PowerPoint :/. I will come up with a solution in a future slide set based on this one, probably anyways.
